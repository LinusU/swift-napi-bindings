# N-API Swift Bindings

This package provides bindings to the [Node.js N-API](https://nodejs.org/api/n-api.html) so that you can build Node.js Addons in Swift.

**Note:** This is very much a work in progress, expect the API to change drastically between versions! I'll be adding documentation for how to get up and running, and building addons soonâ„¢
